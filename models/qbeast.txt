Play Information ---------------------------------------------------------------

Description : This level has been thought to take part to the Nunuk's geometry
competition 2002 edition (www.planetquake.com/nunuk).
As the name of the comp already suggests, I had to
focus on the architecture of the map, trying to make amazing shapes and
original structures. A maximum of 12 textures has been allowed.
The map is a space tourney map.
Ah... I must advice you... Klesk plays the level like a god.
